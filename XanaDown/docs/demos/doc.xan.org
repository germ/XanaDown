* Wormwood & Xanadu

  This project is a [[X!link:society-of-the-spectacle.muse,match=/\* 207\s*(.*?)\n/][fork]] of Ted Nelson's [[http://xanadu.com/][Project Xanadu]], and specifically of the
  [[http://perma.pub/xanaviewer3/][xanaviewer]] put together by his Cambridge team.

  I've reverse-engineered a primitive Xanadoc server & spruced up both the
  server and client with a few additions of my own. That's [[X!link:spec.org,match=/which I'm calling \*(Wormwood)\*/][Wormwood]].

  The source code for both the client and viewer can be found on [[https://gitlab.com/krampus/wormwood][gitlab]].

  By the way, click the /layout widget/ in the lower-right-hand-corner of your
  screen if you'd like to change how these documents are laid out.

** Project Xanadu

  Project Xanadu is a hypertext document system --- in fact, the original
  hypertext system. The basic form of Xanadu document is the
  xanadoc. [[X!span:tnelson-xanasimp.txt,match=/The xanadoc is.*?content\./]]

  [[X!span:tnelson-xanasimp.txt,match=/This has many.*?and many more\./,inline=0]]

  "Normal" links --- a.k.a. [[https://www.google.com/search?q=jump+link][jumplinks]] --- are only one way to link one document
  to another. In a xanadoc, you can link [[X!link:tnelson-HTdefOgl.txt,start=109,length=105][the individual parts of a document]] with
  a xanalink. You can also grab a piece of another document and pull it in using
  /transclusion./

*** Format Specification

    The *official* Xanadu format spec is (as of writing) unfixed and
    unpublished; in Ted's own words:

    [[X!span:xuDemoPage.html,match=/We are.*change./,inline=0]]

    Wormwood's Xanadu format spec has been reverse-engineered from Ted's
    examples. Any cross-compatibility with the Cambridge spec, or any other
    Xanadu implementation, should be viewed as a convenient coincidence without
    pretense of official or unofficial support in the future.

    [[X!link:spec.org,match=/\* (Classic Xanadu)/,inline=1][See the Wormwood spec documentation for more information.]]

** On to Wormwood

   Having watched some of Ted's propaganda, I was positively *hyped* to start
   reading /and/ writing documents in parallel in the xana-space! But I quickly
   found his demo viewer somewhat limiting --- not to mention, using a document
   server from some guy's web page to view my own xanadocs I was creating on my
   own PC felt more than a little /needy./

   Hence Wormwood! Among the [[X!link:spec.org,match=/\* (Planned Features)/][extended functionality]]:

   - Documents are formatted using [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]].

     This means your xanadocs can use markdown, org-mode, HTML, and any other
     pandoc-supported format --- you can even [[X!link:warranty.md,match=/([^\n]+)\n$/][mix-and-match via transclusion]]!

   - A brand-new open-source xanadoc server from scratch.

     Here's a nifty feature: you can pass a URL pointing to an EDL or XanOrg doc
     via CGI parameters. In other words, you can [[/cgi-bin/view.cgi?url=/docs/demo/doc.xan.org][link directly to xanadocs]]
     so your whole crew can fly thru xana-space, too.

   - A new structured Xanadoc markup format. I call it [[X!link:spec.org,match=/\* (XanOrg)/][XanOrg]].

     XanOrg is a [[X!span:spec.org,match=/A (very new idea.*?)\n\n/]]

   - The souped-up /xanaviewer/, which you are presumably using right this very
     moment.

     You can change the document layout tiling strategy by clicking the widget
     in the lower right-hand corner of the window. Notifications and errors are
     shown in the lower left-hand corner.

     - Using the [[X!link:/static/client/tile.strategies.html,match=/Stack strategy/][stack]] strategy, your xanadoc is placed on the left and
       sourcedocs are /stacked/ on the right. You can reorganize sourcedocs by
       dragging them, and the divider gap can be resized and moved much the
       same.

     - Using the [[X!link:/static/client/tile.strategies.html,match=/Float strategy/][float]] strategy, all documents can be moved and resized however
       you like by dragging the document's title bar and edges, respectively.
