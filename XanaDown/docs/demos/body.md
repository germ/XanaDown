Wormwood & Xanadu
-----------------

This project is a fork of Ted Nelson's [Project Xanadu](http://xanadu.com), and
specifically of the [xanaviewer](http://perma.pub/xanaviewer3/) put together by
his Cambridge team.

Project Xanadu is a hypertext document system --- in fact, the original
hypertext system. The basic form of Xanadu document is the xanadoc. (tc to
xanasimp)

"Normal" links ---
a.k.a. _[jumplinks](https://www.google.com/search?q=jump+link)_ --- are only one
way to link one document to another. In a xanadoc, you can link the individual
parts of a document with a xanalink. You can also grab a piece of another
document and pull it in using _transclusion:_
